Hi, my name is Joicy.
<p>I am an aspiring data analyst with a great passion for solving problems. I am deeply interested in technology and have a strong enthusiasm for learning to code. I enjoy working with data and creating visual stories with numbers and data. Additionally, I am known as a good explainer and enjoy teaching others.</p>

# Projects

## Optimization Of Machine Downtime
<a href="[Optimizing Machine Downtime]">
<p>
<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1raLF3iwDgwJcbO1KUrxwr9dvt8a9AXqN/view?usp=drive_link">
In this project, I implemented a machine learning model for optimizing machine downtime. </a> </p>
<p> The project was conducted as part of my final year postgraduate internship. In this project a machine learning model was created using python which achieved an accuracy of 98%. The RandomForestClassifier algorithm was selected for its ability to handle complex datasets with non-linear relationships and its robustness to overfitting. Utilizing advanced analytical techniques in Python, trends and patterns were uncovered, enriching strategic decision-making processes. </p>

## Climatic Trends in Sirumalai

This project analyzed climatic trends over a period of fice years to provide insights and analyze changes.</a></p>
<p>
Sirumalai is a hill ecosystem situated in TamilNadu, India. This study thoroughly examines climatic nuances, meticulously analysing meteorological data spanning five years from 2018-2022.</p>
<p>
Climatic Data was collected from online data repositories, pre-processed and cleaned. Data was analyzed using Correlation and visualization(using times series histogram and plots) to understand yearly trends in climate data using Microsoft Excel.

# Visualizations

<p>These are some of the visualizations that I have done using Excel, Tableau and PowerBI. I believe that visuals help data to tell stories which it could never speak before. So visualization is an importantfar of analytics to communicate finidings to other stakeholders..</p>
