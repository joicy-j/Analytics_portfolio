In this project, I implemented a machine learning model for optimizing machine downtime.</a></p>
<p>The project was conducted as part of my final year postgraduate internship. In this project a machine learning model was created using python which achieved an accuracy of 98%. The RandomForestClassifier algorithm was selected for its ability to handle complex datasets with non-linear relationships and its robustness to overfitting.
Utilizing advanced analytical techniques in Python, trends and patterns were uncovered, enriching strategic decision-making processes.</p>

This project analyzed climatic trends over a period of fice years to provide insights and analyze changes.</a></p>
<p>
Sirumalai is a hill ecosystem situated in TamilNadu, India. This study thoroughly examines climatic nuances, meticulously analysing meteorological data spanning five years from 2018-2022.</p>
<p>
Climatic Data was collected from online data repositories, pre-processed and cleaned. Data was analyzed using Correlation and visualization(using times series histogram and plots) to understand yearly trends in climate data using Microsoft Excel.
