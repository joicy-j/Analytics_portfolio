In this project, I implemented a machine learning model for optimizing machine downtime.</a></p>
<p>The project was conducted as part of my final year postgraduate internship. In this project a machine learning model was created using python which achieved an accuracy of 98%. The RandomForestClassifier algorithm was selected for its ability to handle complex datasets with non-linear relationships and its robustness to overfitting.
Utilizing advanced analytical techniques in Python, trends and patterns were uncovered, enriching strategic decision-making processes.
