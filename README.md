Hi, my name is Joicy.
<p>I am an aspiring data analyst with a great passion for solving problems. I am deeply interested in technology and have a strong enthusiasm for learning to code. I enjoy working with data and creating visual stories with numbers and data. Additionally, I am known as a good explainer and enjoy teaching others.</p>

In this project, I implemented the deep learning method for object localization (finding objects in an image) proposed in <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1raLF3iwDgwJcbO1KUrxwr9dvt8a9AXqN/view?usp=drive_link">this research paper</a>..</p>

<p>Computer vision has innumerable real-world applications. This project was my introduction to the world of computer vision research. Since the conclusion of this project, I have focused heavily on researching recent advances in convolutional neural network architectures. Furthermore, I have made an emphasis on learning how to apply these concepts using Tensorflow and Keras.</p>
